<!DOCTYPE html>  <!-- NEEDED -->

<!--
  ********************************
  <html> tag

  The <html> tag tells the browser that this is an HTML document.
  The <html> tag represents the root of an HTML document.
  The <html> tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the
  <!DOCTYPE> tag).
  Only one <html> tag is allowed. If you write multiple <html> tags, the
  browser might not be able to display property.

  You can omit <html> tag, but it is good to write for a readable code.
  You can set __global attributes__ to <html> tag. Common attributes are:
      - lang (specifies a languags in this html document)
      - class (specifies a global class name (used in CSS) in this html
        document)
