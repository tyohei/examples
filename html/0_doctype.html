  DOCTYPE declaration

  The <!DOCTYPE> __declaration__ must be the very first thing in your HTML
  document, before the <html> tag.
  The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is NOT an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the
  web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.

  Basically, simple HTML5 document does not care about upppercase or lowercase,
  but it is good practice to use upppercase for several reasons (not metioned
  here).

  You can omit DOCTYPE declaration, however, the __mode__ will differ between
  DOCTYPE and no DOCTYPE. w/o DOCTYPE, the browser will be strict mode, and w/
  DOCTYPE the browser will be transitional mode.
