  <head> element

  The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is
  placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.
  HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.

  <head> tag MUST be as the FIRST element in an <html> element. That means you
  cannot use multiple <head> tag (the second <head> element is not a first
  element in <html> element).

  The tags that describe metadata are
    - <title>
    - <style>
    - <meta>
    - <link>
    - <script>
    - <base>

  Omitting the <head> tag has been a common practice for quite some time now.

        - defines a title in the browser
        - provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
        - displays a title for the page in search engine results

    <title>This is a title</title>

      The <meta> element is used to specify which character set is used, page
      description, keywords, author, and other metadata. Metadata is used by
      browsers (how to display content), by search engines (keywords), and
      other web services.

      <meta> element is a empty element, that has no content. Other empty
      element in HTML is <br>.
    -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">  <!-- Define the charset -->
    <meta name="description", content="

    description can be any length, however 300 alphabetic chars is recommended
    by Google.

    <meta name="author", content="Yohei TSUJI">
    <meta http-equiv="refresh", content="30">
    <!--
      The http-equiv attribute provides an HTTP header for the
      information/value of the content attribute.
    -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!--
      HTML5 introduced a method to let web designers take control over the
      viewport, through the <meta> tag.
      The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the
      device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.
      You SHOULD include the following <meta> viewport element in all your web
      pages.

      Recent users use smartphone to read and watch a web page.

      THIS document and THAT document.
      You need to specify `href` attribute that specify the URI of THAT
      document.
    -->
    <link rel="icon", type="image/jpg" href="./logo.jpg">
    <!-- This defines a logo in the browser, it is called FAVICON in Web -->
    <!-- Also you can add a `stylesheet` to `rel` attribute -->

    <!--
      The <script> element is used to define client-side JavaScripts.
