Now that you have a renderer, you can start adding images to it. Anything you
want to be made visible in the renderer has to be added to a special Pixi
obejct called ``stage``.
You can access this special ``stage`` object like this:
*/
window.console.log(app.stage);

/*
The ``stage`` is a Pixi ``Container`` object.. You can think of a container as
a kind  of empty box that will group together and store whatever you put
inside it. The ``stage`` object is the root container for all the visible
things in your scene. Whatever you put inside the ``stage`` will be rendered
on the canvas. Right now the ``stage`` is empty, but soon we're going to start
*/

/*
So what do you put on the stage? Special image objects called ___SPRITES___.
Sprites are basically just image that you can control with code. You can
control their position, size, and a host of other properties that are useful
for making interactive and animated graphics. Learning to make and control
sprites is really the most important thing about learning to use Pixi. If you
know how to make sprites and add them to stage, you're just a small step away
from starting to make games.
