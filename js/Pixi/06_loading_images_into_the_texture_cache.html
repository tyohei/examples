Because Pixi renders the image on the GPU with WebGL, the image needs to be in
a format that the GPU can process. A WebGL-ready image is called a
___texture___. Before you can make a sprite display an image, you need to
convert an ordinary image file into a WebGL texture. To keep everything
working fast and efficiently under the hood, Pixi uses a
___texture cache___ to store and reference all the textures your sprites will
need. The name of the textures are strings that match the file locations of the
images they refer to. That means if you have a texture that was loaded from
"./cat.png", you could find it in the texture cache like this.

  PIXI.utils.TextureCache["./cat.png"];

The textures are stored in a WebGL compatible format that's efficient for
Pixi's renderer to work with. You can then use Pixi's ``Sprite`` class to make
a new sprite using the texture.

  let texture = PIXI.utils.TextureCache["./cat.png"];
  let sprite = new PIXI.Sprite(texture);

But how do you load the image file and convert it into texture?
Use Pixi's built-in ``loader`` object.
Pixi's development team recommends that if you use the loader, you should
create the sprite by referencing the texture in the ``loader``'s
``resources`` object.
*/
PIXI.loader.add("./cat.png")
           .load(setup);

function setup()
{
  let sprite = new PIXI.Sprite(
    PIXI.loader.resources["./cat.png"].texture
  );
}
/*
This is the general format we'll be using to load images and create sprites in
this tutorial.
You can load multiple image at the same time by listing them with chainable 
``add`` methods, like this

  PIXI.loader.add("./one.png")
             .add("./two.png")
             .add("./three.png")
             .load(setup);

Or maybe better

  PIXI.loader.add([
    "./one.png",
    "./two.png",
    "./three.png"
  ])
             .load(setup)
*/
