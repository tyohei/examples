# Code reading of Apache Spark

According to [Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-step-by-step-understand-Apache-spark-source-code),
it is good to read [the source code released in 2012](https://github.com/apache/spark/tree/5b021ce0990ec675afc6939cc2c06f041c973d17/core/src/main/scala/spark).

Also reading [some notes](https://github.com/JerryLead/SparkInternals) seems
to be a good option to understand Spark architecture.
